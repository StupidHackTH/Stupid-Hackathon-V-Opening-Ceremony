This was the first challenge during the During the opening event of this hackathon 
The challenge was to cumulatively as a community refresh a webpage one million times 
[It looked something like this.](https://betich.github.io/stupid-opening-ceremony/) [ze thinggy](https://betich.github.io/stupid-opening-ceremony/)
                                                             
_there were no rules_
                                                                        
This of corse means that all types of solution for this challenge were on the table such as utilization of botnets, ddos and scripts :P 
```bash
#an example of one such script
while true; 
  do
    sleep 1; 
    curl <url for the event https://betich.github.io/stupid-opening-ceremony/>; 
  done
```
