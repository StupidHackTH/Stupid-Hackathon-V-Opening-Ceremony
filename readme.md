# Stupid-Hackathon-V-Opening-Ceremony
This was the first challenge during the During the opening event of this hackathon 
The challenge was to cumulatively as a community refresh a webpage one million times 
                                                                                    
_there were no rules_
                                                                                      
This of corse means that all types of solution for this challenge were on the table such as utilization of botnets and ddos scripts :P 
```pankace
#an example of one such script
while true; do sleep 1; curl https://stupid-hack-start-jtoj4b34ca-as.a.run.app/; done
```
