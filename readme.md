# Stupid-Hackathon-V-Opening-Ceremony
This was the first challenge during the During the opening event of this hackathon 
The challenge was to cumulatively as a community refresh a webpage one million times 
(Tt looked something like this.)[https://betich.github.io/stupid-opening-ceremony/] (ze thinggy)[https://betich.github.io/stupid-opening-ceremony/]
<br/>
                                                                     
_there were no rules_
                                                                        
This of corse means that all types of solution for this challenge were on the table such as utilization of botnets and ddos scripts :P 
```bash
#an example of one such script
while true; do sleep 1; curl https://stupid-hack-start-jtoj4b34ca-as.a.run.app/; done
```
